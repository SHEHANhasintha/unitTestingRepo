This is an simple example of unit test that's written in Node.js.
The program simply performs a calculation which is adding two numbers together. 
*getstarted-------
#	open cmd
$	type in "node ."
That will start the program.
#unit.js module consist of few debug points.
	$type in node inspect debugging-index
#	type "c", to continue the program on cmd in each end every debugging point.
#type in "help" to view guidelines for the node.js debugging command tool.

#the system checks for sertaint things that are required.
#the unit test, tests the number1 and number2 inputs against the output.
([n] => negative, long => long amount numbers, short => short amount numbers)

	number1				number2
_______________________________________
	integer				integer
	integer				float
	float[n]			float
	float[n]			float[n]
	float[long]			float[long]
	float[long]			float[short]
	float[long-n]		float[long-n]
	float[long-n]		float[n]
	float				float[long-n]
	zero				float[long-n]
	integer[long]		integer[long]
